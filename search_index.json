This database was consolidated by the Clean Air and health Research Data and Analysis Technology (CARDAT) platform, overseen by the Centre for Safe Air (CSA) (formerly the Centre for Air pollution, energy and health Research (CAR)) and the WHO Collaborating Centre for Climate Change and Health Impact Assessment. It aims to standardise the national collection of data from all government air pollution monitors in Australia. The data are available in a larger repository of geospatial data for modelling air pollution exposure, health burden and impact. For more information see the CARDAT homepage. The database is available for research purposes. Please see section @ref(#using-napmd) and inquire by email to CARDAT. 1.1 Acknowledgements and thanks This database was made possible through the fantastic co-operation, support and data from Australian state and territory government agencies: ACT Health Department NSW Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) NT Environment Protection Authority QLD Department of Environment, Science and Innovation SA Environment Protection Authority Environmental Protection Authority Tasmania WA Department of Water and Environmental Regulation Environmental Protection Authority Victoria 1.2 Funding With thanks to the Centre for Safe Air and the Australian Research Data Commons for providing the funding to make the National Air Pollution Monitoring Database possible.

It consists of a schema (air_pollution_monitors) in a larger PostGIS database called PostGIS CAR and sits alongside of other geospatial data that can be used for modelling air pollution and health impact assessments. PostGIS CAR Database 3.2 Table structure The tables are structured into three types: Hourly data: There are individual hourly data tables by state and year which are incorporated into a single master table for hourly data. Daily data: There are individual daily data tables by state and year which are incorporated into a single master table for daily data. Station locations: There are individual station location tables by state, which are incorporated into a single master table for station locations. The image below shows the basic relationship between the major tables. NAPMD Database Structure Note that individual station location tables hold additional columns that are not available via the master table.

The year, date and hour fields are in local time, without daylight savings. Timezones are as follows: UTC+08:00: WA UTC+09:30: NT, SA UTC+10:00: ACT, NSW, QLD, VIC, TAS All times are shown in UTC in the date_time_utc field, stored as a timestamp with time zone in PostgreSQL. Please note that some programs will automatically convert the UTC timezone to the local system timezone on retrieval from the database. Ensure that you are working in your desired time zone when manipulating this field. 4.5 Standardisation 4.5.1 Variable and units All variable and unit names have been expressed in alphanumeric characters only with no whitespace. For some variables, reporting units differ across agencies. Conversion factors are shown in Table 4.2. Table 4.2: Conversion factors used for standardisation. from to conversion ppb ppm ppm = 0.001 * ppb pphm ppm ppm = 0.01 * pphm 10^-4_per_m Mm^-1 Mm^-1 = 100 * 10^-4_per_m atm hPa hPa = 1013.25 * atm mbar hPa hPa = mbar km/hr m/s m/s = 1000/(60 * 60) * km/hr 4.5.2 Time basis (hour-ending/starting) The National Air Pollution Monitor Database converts all hourly data to be in 0-23 hour-beginning format (i.e. 0 represents midnight to 1am on the date specified). For different states and territories the source data can vary. State Data source Time basis ACT All data 0-23 hour-ending NSW All data 1-24 hour-ending NT All data 1-24 hour-ending Qld Open Portal downloads 0-23 hour-beginning Historical database extracts 1-24 hour-ending SA Non-historic data 0-23 hour-ending Spreadsheets pre-2003 (gases) 0-23 hour-beginning Spreadsheets pre-2005 (PM2.5) 0-23 hour-beginning Tas N/A N/A Vic All data 0-23 hour-beginning WA All data 0-23 hour-ending 4.5.3 Station names Station names have been generally cleaned by converting to lowercase with underscores, removing all non-alphanumeric characters and whitespace. Names may differ substantially from the original station name where: - two stations are co-located (e.g. one station is a regular air quality monitor, the second is part of a rural network or sensor network) - a station has moved locations (the agency regards the station is the same station but NAPMD will list the new location under a new station name, typically suffixed ’_post_YYYY_MM_DD’, with the date it moved) Note that the station name within a state will be unique, however different states may use the same station name (e.g. Richmond in both NSW and Victoria). Source identifiers are kept with the station names where possible so that they can be cross-referenced with the original data. Use the source identifier to find continuous data for stations which have moved locations over time. 4.5.4 Station locations Please note that NAPMD station coordinates may differ from the source data coordinates. This may be for a variety of reasons: The station has moved and the source data coordinates only show the most recent location The station has been more accurately geocoded than the source data coordinates (typically with the help of Google Maps and Google Earth) The coordinates are set to 0, 0 (hidden) in the source data and have been removed entirely in NAPMD "],["conditions-of-use.html", "5 Conditions of use 5.1 ACT Health 5.2 NSW DCCEEW 5.3 NT EPA 5.4 Qld DESI 5.5 SA EPA 5.6 EPA Tasmania 5.7 EPA Victoria 5.8 WA DWER", " 5 Conditions of use The National Air Pollution Monitoring Database data are not to be on-shared without permission from the Centre for Safe Air.

Access is granted individually on request to CARDAT - please put NAPMD access in the subject line to assist with granting access sooner. You will be asked to read and acknowledge conditions of use and disclaimers prior to being given access. 6.1 Accessing the database Users can choose between an API login or a database login. The API allows for easier but less flexible retrieval of data by providing specific parameters (e.g. station ID, parameter name, datetime). Using a database connection is more flexible but requires knowledge of SQL queries. See the Appendix for R (API functions) and SQL (database queries) code snippets. Data in NAPMD is subject to change as new, updated or amended data becomes available. We strongly recommend you save a copy of extracted data for your analysis if reproducibility is required. 6.2 Cite the data and report outcomes In your publications using these data please remember to abide by the conditions of use, in particular: cite the National Air Pollution Monitoring Database contact Tas EPA to confirm usage is acceptable (if using Tasmanian data) cite the relevant NSW paper (if using NSW data) report usage back to us so we can let the relevant state and territory organisations know how their data are being used [car.data@sydney.edu.au][11] 6.3 Using the database Air pollution data is stored in the database in tables by state and year. If you are querying the database directly, you will most usually want to access more than one state’s or year’s worth of data at once, which can be done via the following tables: ap_monitor_data_master: 1-hrly averaged data ap_monitor_data_daily_master: daily averaged data (available where hourly averaged data is not available) ap_monitor_locations_master: station location data For recent years, most data is available by hour only and is not included in the daily averaged data. The exception is Tasmanian data, which provides daily averages from the BlanKeT network. The daily data table also include historical data that is otherwise not available by hour. 6.4 Questions about the data, and reporting improbable values The NAPMD is a collaborative database between the state and territory governments, the Centre for Safe Air and our users. We ask that you contact us (car.data@sydney.edu.au) with any question about the data or improbable values you find so that we can ensure the data is being used in a fit for purpose manner and is of the highest quality.
